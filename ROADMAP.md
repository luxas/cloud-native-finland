### Roadmap for the site

It's very early days for this site / initiative.
Here are some technical TODOs for the site:

 - Run the full kube-prometheus suite to be able to easily check the state of the cluster
 - Use helm charts instead of hand-copied files
 - Upgrade to prometheus 2.0 when available
 - Create a Kubernetes CronJob for snapshotting PV data and uploading somewhere
 - More documentation how to install it yourself
 - Create "fork me on Github" banner
